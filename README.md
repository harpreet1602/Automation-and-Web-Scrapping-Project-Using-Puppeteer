# Automation-and-Web-Scrapping-Project-Using-Puppeteer
I have made a Covid 19 related project on Automation and Web Scrapping using puppeteer.
As we are going through a very tough time that is why I thought to make a project that can help the society.

This project will fetch all the information required to educate an individual about the Coronavirus like total number of cases, latest news, symptoms, preventions, treatment, total vaccine doses given all over the world, vaccine side affects, covid testing centres and vaccination centres near me.   

Not only this but also it will fetch all the verified contacts for the important resources that people need in this tough times like Oxygen cylinders, Hospital beds, Online consultation, Food supply, Home quarantine, Ambulance service. 

The data will be updated whenever the script is run again.
